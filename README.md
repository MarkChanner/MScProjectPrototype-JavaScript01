# MScProjectPrototype-JavaScript01

HTML5 version of Android tile matching game that I have been working on as part of my MSc Computer Science final project.

I did not know JavaScript prior to starting work on this prototype version and learnt as I went along with translating the Java/Android code into JavaScript. I also read Doug Crockford's book 'JavaScript: The Good Parts' to help avoid some of JavaScript's pitfalls. 

The code itself still leaves much to be desired, and will be improved upon in subsequent iterations.
