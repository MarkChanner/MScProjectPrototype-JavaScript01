# MScProjectPrototype-JavaScript01

HTML5 version of Android app to help children with autism spectrum conditions to recognize facial emotion expressions.  
It is a tile matching game that I have been working on as part of my MSc Computer Science final project, due in Sep 2016.  

I did not know JavaScript prior to starting work on this prototype version and have learnt as I went along with translating the Java/Android code into JavaScript. I also referenced Doug Crockford's book 'JavaScript: The Good Parts' to help avoid some of JavaScript's pitfalls.
